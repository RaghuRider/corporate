        <p class="p1">When it&rsquo;s time to add compelling new features across channels and devices, start with Commerce Cubes from AIEnterprise to accelerate your time to value, increase agility and push functionality towards the edge. Commerce Cubes are pre-engineered microsolutions that can be installed, &ldquo;on the side,&rdquo; to quickly integrate with your existing commerce platform instead of spending months wading through complex architecture and costly testing cycles required to extend large systems in situ.</p>

        <p class="p1"><span class="s1">AIEnterprise is constantly evolving its library of Commerce Cubes to zoom in on classic commerce challenges related to inventory, loyalty, promotions, cross device session management and many other omnichannel topics. Commerce Cubes are delivered with well documented APIs and SDKs that facilitate integration into native devices, web interfaces, and platforms. These solutions are delivered as microservices that can be deployed in public or private clouds au-natural or be easily customized to fill bespoke requirements. They are independently scalable, making them ideally suited for core application services or to enhance adaptive interfaces.</span></p>

Using Commerce Cubes to jumpstart new customer flows and differentiating new features reduces the cost of innovation and prevents loss due to platform or vendor lock-in that often accompanies traditional customizations. </span></p>
